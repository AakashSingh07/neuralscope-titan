# 🚀 Meta AI Agent GUI

A powerful **Meta AI Agent Desktop Application** built with **Python and Tkinter** that performs sentiment analysis, generates data visualizations, and creates automated PDF reports.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of AI concepts combined with GUI development, making it an excellent portfolio project for roles in **AI, Data Science, and Python Development.**

---

## 📌 Overview

The Meta AI Agent is designed to simulate how intelligent agents analyze data and present insights visually.

The application allows users to:

✅ Enter an AI agent goal  
✅ Run automated sentiment analysis  
✅ View real-time data distribution charts  
✅ Generate professional PDF reports  
✅ Interact through a clean desktop GUI  

This project focuses on **performance, simplicity, and real-world usability.**

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 AI Sentiment Analysis
- Uses **TextBlob NLP** to analyze sentiment polarity.
- Classifies text as **Positive, Negative, or Neutral.**

### 📊 Data Visualization
- Automatically generates a histogram showing data distribution.
- Built using **Matplotlib embedded inside Tkinter.**

### 📄 Automated PDF Reports
- Creates downloadable reports with agent results.
- Implemented using **ReportLab.**

### ⚡ Fast Model Loading
- Simulated lightweight model loading.
- No heavy downloads required.

### 🖥️ Desktop GUI
- Built completely with **Tkinter**
- Smooth and responsive interface
- Scrollable output console
